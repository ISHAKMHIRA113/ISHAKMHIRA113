Welcome Lady's and Gentlemen to my Github page, nothing new at all sometimes there's something to do otherwise i'm just scrolling for interesting builds
i'm a dev, 17yo, casually fixing android phones whatever the disease is i'm the cure
6 years of experience in windows os, i have flashable pills in my pockets if a pc got a bsod
5 years of experience at android os n' devices, take for an example your outdated sad galaxy S III, i'll make it happy twice the time with LineageOs 21.1 or 22.1 thanks to HTML6405, literary any problem in an android phone is an easy target to me to fix.
yeah let's not forget the goddamn espresso, our survival gear in this digital battle, we're fighting lige vilrumites
anyway if you have a custom rom and you wanna dev it more and get partner or wanna set up a team i'm easy to pick and smart as google's servers and my vision is as clear as GTX5090
